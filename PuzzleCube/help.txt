'X' rotates the cube clockwise along the x-axis which is the horizontal axis
'Y' rotates the cube clockwise along the y-axis which is the vertical axis
'Z' rotates the cube clockwise along the z-axis which is the depth axis

'R' is the right face of the cube
'L' is the left face of the cube
'F' is the front face of the cube
'B' is the back face of the cube
'U' is the up face of the cube
'D' is the down face of the cube

The 'U' face is the one at the top
The 'F' face is the one below that
The 'R' face is the face on the right

'R', 'L', 'U', 'D', 'F', and 'B' are the layer twists and the number after is the layer
The layer must be between '1' and the size of the cube. If no layer is entered it defaults to '1'
All twist are clockwise relative to the face
For example, 'F2' twists the second layer of the front face clockwise one quarter turn

Multiple twist can be entered in one command
For example, 'U2U2U2R1F1' twists the second layer of the up face clockwise three quarter turns,
then twists the first layer of the right face clockwise one quarter turn, then twists the
first layer of the front face clockwise one quarter turn

Type 'V' to change to a 2D representation of the cube, and type 'V' again to switch back to 3D
